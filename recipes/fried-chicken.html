        <h1>Fried Chicken Recipe</h1>

        <h4>Fried chicken, also called Southern fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces that have been coated with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.</h4>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Chicken</b> : We use the whole bird instead of buying individual chicken pieces. <em>Cutting up a whole chicken</em> creates a nice assortment of white and dark meat while also ensuring all the pieces are cut into even sizes.</li>
            <li><b>The batter</b> : We tackle the chicken coating in two steps. First, there’s a batter of flour, eggs and water. This evenly coats the chicken and prevents the breading from falling off. Next, we dip the chicken in seasoned flour, which helps the chicken become as crispy as possible when it hits the hot oil.</li>
            <li><b>The seasonings</b> : We use a flavorful mixture of garlic salt, paprika, black pepper and <em>poultry seasoning</em>. This blend includes dried sage, thyme, rosemary, marjoram and nutmeg. If you don’t have garlic salt on hand, mix your own by combining one part garlic powder with three parts salt (i.e., one teaspoon garlic powder and three teaspoons salt).</li>
            <li><b>Oil</b>: The best oils for frying are neutral oils, like canola and safflower oil. Their higher smoke points make them ideal for frying chicken and other foods.</li>
            <ul> 
                <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons garlic salt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons pepper, divided</li>
                <li>2-1/2 teaspoons poultry seasoning</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1-1/2 cups water</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 broiler/fryer chickens (3-1/2 to 4 pounds each), cut up</li>
                <li>Oil for deep-fat frying</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large shallow dish, combine 2-2/3 cups flour, garlic salt, paprika, 2-1/2 teaspoons pepper and poultry seasoning. In another shallow dish, beat eggs and 1-1/2 cups water; add salt and the remaining 1-1/3 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Dip chicken in egg mixture, then place in flour mixture, a few pieces at a time. Turn to coat.</li>
            <li>In a deep-fat fryer, heat oil to 375°. Fry chicken, several pieces at a time, until chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, 7-8 minutes on each side. Drain on paper towels.</li>
